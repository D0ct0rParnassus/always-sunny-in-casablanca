 Historical Weather Forecast Comparison to Actuals (BASH SCRIPT)

# Overview
This repository is to show the process of how I created this BASH script, the steps involved to create it, with of course the final script itself. 
This is the final project for the IBM LX0117EN Linux Commands & Shell Scripting course through edex. This write up is to demonstrate my understanding of the material and ability to apply the skills.
